## Description
This app tests your knowledge of front-end development basics. 
This app aims to create a quiz demo which helps you test your knowledge of the fundamentals of front-end development. It is currently limited to 6 questions and can add more as the occasion demands. it features questions basically on Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

Javascript is the major language used here, and although there are inclusions from HTML and CSS, the main reason behind Javascript's usage here is to dynamically display the questions based on the user's prompts.  

Some challenges faced while building this project were time constraints as I had to get it done quickly while learning Javascript basics.


## Installation 
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository using git clone</li>
    <li>Open index.html file in your browser</li>
</ol>

## Usage
The application runs in the browser and it dynamically displays the questions. On the landing page, there is a start button which initiates the first question, here you will notice the time is zero, and the time countdown starts as soon as the start button is clicked.

<div>

</div>

Each question comes with multiple choice options which you are allowed to click to make a choice, depending on your choice, a sound is played to notify you of the right or wrong answer choice.
if you choose a wrong answer, 10 secs is deducted from your time and it displays the next question, however, if you choose the right answer, it also moves to the next question but your time counts down normally

At the end of the last question or the end of the countdown, whichever comes first, the remaining time is stored as your high score which you can view from the link on the left-hand corner of the screen.
