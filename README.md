## Description
This app tests your knowledge of front-end development basics. 
The purpose of this app is to create a quiz demo which helps you to test your knowledge on the fundamentals of front-end. It is currently limited to 6 questions with the capacity to add more as the occassion may demand. it features questions obasically on Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

Javascript is the major language used here, although there are inclusions from HTML and CSS, the main reason behind Javascript usage here is to dynamicalluy display the questions based on user's prompts.  

Some challenges faced while building this project wass time constraints as i had to get it done withjin a very short time while learning Javascript basics.

## Usage
The application runs in browser and it dynamically displays the questions. At the landing page, there is a start button which initiates the first question, here you will notice the time is zero, the time countdown starts as soon as the start button is clicked.

Each question comes with multiple choice options which you are allowed to click to make a choice, depending of your choice, a sound is played to notify you of right or wrong answer choice.
if you chhose a wrong answer, 10 secs is deducted from your time and it displays the next question, however, if you choose a right answer, it also moves to the next question but you time countsdown normally
